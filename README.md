This project compares various ML models and CNN architectures to provide accurate diagnosis and potential treatment guidance.

# Skin Disease Detection in Nepal using Machine Learning and CNN

This project focuses on early detection and classification of common skin diseases in Nepal, using machine learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal is to help users identify skin conditions like Eczema, Fungal Infections, and Acne and provide potential treatment guidance.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a web application where users can upload images of skin conditions for classification. The application compares several machine learning and CNN models to identify the disease and suggests appropriate remedies. 

### Key Features

- **Disease Detection**: Identifies common skin diseases prevalent in Nepal.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates the accuracy of traditional ML methods and CNN architectures.
- **User Guidance**: Offers basic treatment and care recommendations based on identified conditions.

### Project Goals

1. **Enhance Early Diagnosis**: By using an accessible web interface, users can receive preliminary insights into skin conditions.
2. **Model Accuracy Analysis**: This project aims to compare model effectiveness to find the best approach for skin disease classification.
3. **Public Health Support**: Provides potential healthcare support in areas with limited dermatological resources.

## Technical Details

- **Datasets**: Pre-existing datasets for Eczema, Fungal Infections, and Acne, focusing on cases in Nepal.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes traditional ML methods alongside CNN architectures.
- **Web Application**: Built to allow users to upload images, get disease classification, and receive suggested remedies.
